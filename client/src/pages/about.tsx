                The Ruwe Holy Ghost Church emerged from the Roho religion, an independent African Christian movement among the Luo people in Western Kenya. This movement traces its origins to the early 20th century and developed as a distinct entity, breaking away from established mainstream missions.

                Archdeacon Walter Edwin Owen, a prominent missionary from the Church Missionary Society (CMS) in Western Kenya, was acquainted with Alfayo Odongo Mango. Their relationship was strained due to Mango's independent religious activities, such as performing baptisms without missionary sanction. Owen's writings provide valuable context on the broader missionary efforts and colonial dynamics in Kenya during that era, though they do not delve into the specifics of the "Dho Roho" language revelation or the intricate spiritual practices of the Roho church.
