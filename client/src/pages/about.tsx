                Ruwe Holy Ghost Church is one of the African Independent Christian Churches and it's based in East Africa (It's origin can be traced back to 1906/07 when it was revealed to someone called Owalo then it was revealed to Ibrahim Osodo around 1912/14 in Ruwe Sublocation. It was later revealed to Alfayo Odongo in 1918 when he was a Priest/Pastor of Anglican CMS at Mombasa). The movement/denomination was started by Alfayo Odongo Mango (Sirael  Odongo) and Lawi Obonyo Ong'wek (Fweny Lawi) around 1933, after the Holy Spirit had revealed it to both of them on different occasions.

                  <p className="text-gray-600 text-sm">
                    Reverend Alfayo Odongo Mango is recognized as the patriarch and a pivotal figure (Founder) of all Roho churches. His leadership of the Roho (Holy Spirit) movement commenced in the 1920s. His early life included formal schooling, with Walter Chadwick, Archdeacon Owen's predecessor and founder of the Church Missionary Society (CMS) mission station at Butere, taking an interest in his education. Central to Mango's spiritual authority was his profound experience of "possession by Roho".

                    Fweny Lawi, Alfayo Odongo's nephew, played a crucial supporting role in the Roho movement. He is remembered as a carpenter and a charismatic miracle-worker, divinely designated as "the helper" (jakony) for the nascent Roho community. His spiritual gifts were instrumental in attracting followers; he is credited with curing individuals like Patricia Amis of a chin ailment and Nora Nyadero of demon possession.

                  The killings were perpetrated by Wanga warriors, often referred to as "Jokawango" by the Luo, stemming from escalating tensions between the Roho followers and the Wanga community. The events of this period, particularly January 20th and 21st, 1934, were a culmination of various conflicts, including a notable confrontation involving Roho women soldiers with Abuodha and Mfuana.

                    Leadership Succession
                  </h3>
                  <p className="text-gray-700 text-sm md:text-base">
                    Following the martyrdom of Alfayo Odongo Mango, <strong>Barnaba Waluoho Ojoro</strong> succeeded him as the leader of the Roho movement, serving as Bishop or "Archbishop" from 1934 until 1980. His long tenure as Bishop was crucial for the post-martyrdom continuity and stability of the nascent church. Barnaba Waluoho specifically led the "Roho group at Ruwe," a faction that played a significant role in the efforts to unite various splinter indigenous faith groups. This consolidation was instrumental in the eventual formal registration of the Ruwe Holy Ghost Church in 1972. The swift and effective succession of Barnaba Waluoho as leader in the immediate aftermath of Mango's martyrdom demonstrates that, despite the traumatic loss of its founder and other key figures, the movement possessed a resilient leadership structure capable of ensuring its continuity. Barnaba's extended period of leadership further solidified the church's foundation, guiding it through critical phases of expansion and formal recognition.

                Archdeacon Walter Edwin Owen, a prominent missionary from the Church Missionary Society (CMS) in Western Kenya, was acquainted with Alfayo Odongo Mango. Their relationship was strained due to Mango's independent religious activities, such as performing baptisms without missionary sanction. Owen's writings provide valuable context on the broader missionary efforts and colonial dynamics in Kenya during that era.
